## Overview of the analysis:

To analysis and create summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type that can be used for decision-making for V. Isualize.


## Results:

### A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type

Accordng to the ride-sharing sammary data among the different city types, urban city has the highest total rides, total drivers, and total fares, then suburban and rural,respectively. On the other hand, rural city is the highest average fare per ride and driver, and following by suburban and urban,respectively. In summary, the urban area that has more peopel live in town will have more damand in drivers and user which will generate more fare, but fare rate per ride and driver will be less than suburban and rural areas.

The multiple-line chart shows relatively the total fares for each city type by week for V. Isualize. 
Urban city always has the highest total fares, then suburban and rural,respectively. The week before March has generated the most total fares for all city types, then significately recline untill March. After March, rural and suburban appears relatively linear, but is happening at a slower rate than change in the urban trend.

 

## Summary:
Base one the results above, there are couple recommentdations I would suggest. First, offering promotion for the users in urban as it shows on the dataFrame for urban has total rides less than total drivers. This will increase the business revenue and help the employees(drivers) earns more income. 
Second, reducing fare a bit or offering some promotion for new customers during the slow season(March) for suburban area to increasing more customers and business profit. Lastly, focusing on suburban area since the data shows the opportunity to grow the business.
